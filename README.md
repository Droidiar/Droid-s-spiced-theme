# Droid's spiced theme
Just a fun little theme I made in a few days!

Available on the Marketplace, can be installed locally too.
Marketplace isn't treating this theme well? You can install it from there and have a fine experience but for me it never updates despite telling me it's updated.
And for somereason it's not applying some css that it applies in the extenstion that allows me to change css??? Genuinely for a better time just copy all the css and put it in the css editor extention. Or install locally, that's good too.
